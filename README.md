# Unit 15: Project 2 EyeRead

## User Story

User Story:  Are you an avid reader?  Do you have an interest in reading but don’t know where to begin.  eyeRead is an online book club app where users can login, create reading lists, discuss books they’re currently reading and rate books they have read in the past.

## Project Design

The project has been designed to fetch and render relevant book information from the GOOGLE BOOKS API.  On the first page of the application the user will choose to either "LOGIN" or "SIGN UP" to gain access to the user profile.  Once the user has been verified by logging in the application will take the user to their profile.  Once on the profile page the user has the option to search for books within the SEARCH FIELD.  The GOOGLE BOOKS API will fetch the information for the specified book and render it's TITLE, AUTHOR, BOOK DESCRIPTION and BOOK IMAGE on the profile page.  The user has the option to add the book to either their BOOKS I HAVE READ or BOOKS I WANT TO READ list.  The user will have the ability to add and store comments about the books in their BOOKS I HAVE READ or BOOKS I WANT TO READ list.
